Live Demo: [View Payoo Live](https://ruhit1000.github.io/Payoo-Mobile-Banking-Project/)

Payoo is a fintech-inspired web application built to master JavaScript DOM Manipulation and real-time state management. This project simulates core banking features like secure login, balance tracking, and transaction logic within a mobile-first interface.

🚀 Core Features
Authentication Logic: Simulated secure login with credential validation.

Real-time Transactions: Functional "Add Money" and "Cash Out" features that update the main balance instantly without page refreshes.

Form Validation: Handles user input errors to ensure only valid amounts are processed.

Seamless UI Navigation: Uses a single-page approach (SPA-lite) to switch between different banking sections.

Mobile-First Design: Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile banking experiences.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Modern, utility-first CSS framework).

Tools: Git, GitHub Pages for deployment.

🧠 Key Learnings
This project was a major milestone in my journey from an English Literature student to a Full-Stack Developer. During development, I mastered:

DOM Traversal & Manipulation: How to select and update elements efficiently based on user events.

Logic & Math Flow: Managing data flow to ensure the wallet balance remains accurate across multiple transactions.

Utility-First Styling: Speeding up the UI development process using Tailwind CSS classes.
